"""
BREAK: cmd_queue.py's GET /download endpoint is an unauthenticated arbitrary
local file reader -- `path` is taken straight from the query string and
handed to open()/os.path.isfile() with NO restriction to any upload/temp
directory, and NO auth of any kind.

Where: ~/.hermes/scripts/cmd_queue.py, Queue.do_GET(), the `/download`
branch:

    filepath = params.get("path", [None])[0]
    if filepath and os.path.isfile(filepath):
        with open(filepath, "rb") as f:
            data = f.read()
        ...
        self.wfile.write(data)

Per BRIDGE_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md, `/download` is one of the routes proxied
through the PUBLIC Tailscale Funnel (`https://lightrag.tail4a204c.ts.net/download`
-> 127.0.0.1:9104 -> funnel_ask_router.py -> cmd_queue.py:9092/download),
reachable from the open internet by anyone with the URL, with no token/auth
check anywhere in this handler. Any absolute path readable by the `mishin`
user process -- SSH keys, the jarvis-ask Fernet session keys
(.session_key_<instance>), state.json (contains the live bot token),
/etc/passwd, etc -- can be exfiltrated with a single GET request.

Safety note: this test does NOT touch the real, live cmd_queue.py service
(confirmed running on 127.0.0.1:9092 during this assessment -- see
`ss -ltnp` in the session transcript). Instead it loads the REAL Queue
handler class straight from the actual cmd_queue.py source on disk (via
exec, with only the final unconditional `serve_forever()` call at module
scope stripped out in-memory so import doesn't try to rebind the live
port) and serves it on an OS-assigned ephemeral loopback port, in-process,
for the duration of this test only. Every line of handler logic exercised
below (do_GET, the /download branch, _json) is the real, unmodified,
shipped code -- nothing here is a reimplementation.

Run: python3 test_cmd_queue_download_arbitrary_read.py

UPDATE (post-fix): /download is now scoped to /tmp (os.path.realpath()
resolved, then required to be /tmp itself or a descendant of it -- this
matches the existing convention /upload already uses, which saves every
upload flat into /tmp, and claude_watcher.py's WORKDIR for SEND_FILE, which
is also /tmp). This test now verifies the fix directly: files outside /tmp
(session-encryption keys, state.json, /etc/passwd, a traversal attempt) are
rejected, while a legitimate file the app itself would plausibly write
under /tmp is still servable.
