BREAK: telegram_format.format_message()'s protect/restore placeholder
mechanism uses a predictable, low-entropy sentinel format
(`\\x00PH<counter>\\x00`, counter starting at 0 per call) with NO check
that the real message text doesn't already contain that exact sequence.
If it does, the final "restore placeholders in reverse order" step does a
blind str.replace() of that sentinel -- silently splicing in WHATEVER
OTHER protected fragment (a link, bold text, a code block...) happens to
share that placeholder index, in place of the attacker/tool-controlled
text that was actually there.

Where: ~/.claude-telegram-bridge/telegram_format.py, format_message():

    def _ph(value):
        key = f"\\x00PH{counter[0]}\\x00"
        counter[0] += 1
        placeholders[key] = value
        return key
    ...
    for key in reversed(list(placeholders.keys())):
        text = text.replace(key, placeholders[key])   # <-- blind replace,
                                                        #     matches ANY
                                                        #     occurrence,
                                                        #     not just the
                                                        #     one this call
                                                        #     itself inserted

Realistic trigger path: `format_message()` is called on Claude's own final
answer text (bridge.py's send_message/send_message_chunked/edit_message),
which routinely includes verbatim content Claude read from files/tool
output/web content -- content this bot does not control. A file containing
stray NUL bytes (binary content misread as text, or deliberately crafted
by whoever controls a document Claude is asked to summarize/quote) that
happens to contain the literal bytes `\\x00PH0\\x00` will have THAT exact
span silently replaced by an unrelated piece of the message's own
markdown -- corrupting/injecting content into what the user actually sees
in Telegram, with no error, warning, or indication anything went wrong.

This test calls the REAL, unmodified format_message() from the real
telegram_format.py.

Run: python3 test_format_message_placeholder_collision.py

UPDATE (post-fix): the placeholder key now embeds a random per-call nonce
(secrets.token_hex(8)), verified absent from the input before use -- so a
literal `\x00PH0\x00`-shaped span in real content can no longer collide
with the internal sentinel format at all. The original assertion
(`attacker_text in out`) doesn't actually work as a post-fix check: correct
MarkdownV2 escaping backslash-escapes the hyphens in attacker_text, so the
raw unescaped string is never a substring of correctly-processed output,
fixed or not. This version checks for the correctly ESCAPED form instead
(via the real escape_mdv2()), which is what should actually survive.
